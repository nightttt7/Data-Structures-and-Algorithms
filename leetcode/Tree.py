# Tree

# nodes: root, branches, leaves; childrem, parent, sibling
# nodes: ancestor, descendant
# degree of node: number of childern
# degree of tree: maximum number of childern in tree
# level: root in level 1, any childern level is parent level + 1
# depth/height: maximum level in tree
# edge: connects two nodes
# path: ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges
# binary tree: maximum two children

# 1. List of Lists Representation
myTree = ['a',  # root
          ['b',  # left subtree
           ['d', [], []],
           ['e', [], []]],
          ['c',  # right subtree
           ['f', [], []],
           []]
          ]
